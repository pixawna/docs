# SuperPlane Factory Docs

This repository powers the [SuperPlane Factory](https://github.com/superplanehq/superplane) documentation. SuperPlane is an open source AI software factory that turns development tickets into verified pull requests through repeatable intake, implementation, verification and review workflows.

## About the documentation

The documentation is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), then deployed to [docs.superplane.com](https://docs.superplane.com) through Cloudflare Pages.

It covers:

- Getting started with SuperPlane and building your first factory
- Software factory fundamentals, automations and pipeline stages
- Common use cases for tracked agent work
- Integrations and component reference pages
- Billing, open source participation, support and release notes

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- A current Node.js Long-Term Support (LTS) release
- npm

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superplanehq/docs.git
cd docs
npm install
```

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) to view the site. Astro reloads the page as you edit documentation and components.

## Available commands

Run these commands from the repository root:

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start the local development server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run check:text-only` | Confirm that the repository does not contain unsupported binary assets |
| `npm run generate:llms` | Regenerate `public/llms.txt` and `public/llms-full.txt` |
| `npm run build` | Validate the content and build the production site in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Show the available Astro CLI commands |

`npm run build` runs the text-only check and regenerates the agent-readable documentation files before Astro builds the site.

## Project structure

| Path | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| `src/content/docs/` | Markdown and MDX documentation pages |
| `src/components/` | Custom Astro and Starlight components |
| `src/config/` | Sidebar configuration |
| `src/styles/` | Site-wide styles |
| `src/assets/` | Text-based assets such as SVG files |
| `public/` | Static text files and generated agent indexes |
| `scripts/` | Repository checks and index generation scripts |
| `astro.config.mjs` | Astro and Starlight configuration |
| `AGENTS.md` | Writing and repository guidance |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Local setup and the contribution workflow |

Each `.md` or `.mdx` file under `src/content/docs/` becomes a documentation route. Content is grouped into `get-started`, `fundamentals`, `use-cases`, `integrations`, `components`, `billing`, `open-source`, `troubleshooting` and `release-notes`.

## Write and edit documentation

Before editing content, read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the writing, structure, terminology, linking, diagram and accessibility guidelines used across the site.

When adding or updating a page:

1. Place the file in the appropriate directory under `src/content/docs/`.
2. Add frontmatter with a `title` and a concise `description`.
3. Use site-root paths for internal links, such as `/get-started/overview`.
4. Update `src/config/sidebar.mjs` when the page needs a manual navigation entry.
5. Run `npm run build` to catch invalid slugs, frontmatter errors and broken asset references.

Keep generated files out of manual edits. The build owns `public/llms.txt` and `public/llms-full.txt`.

## Crawler and agent discovery

The deployed site publishes:

- `/robots.txt` for crawler policy and sitemap discovery
- `/llms.txt` for a concise, structured documentation index
- `/llms-full.txt` for tools that need the complete documentation context

The LLM context files are generated automatically during `npm run build` and should not be edited manually. `robots.txt` controls crawler access; `llms.txt` helps an agent locate relevant documentation but does not grant access.
